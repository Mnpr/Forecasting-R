    "## Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Series is a collection of data points indexed based on the time they were collected. Most often, the data is recorded at regular time intervals.\n",
    "- Time Series data introduces a “hard dependency” on previous time steps, so the assumption that independence of observations doesn’t hold.\n",
    "- Properties : Stationarity, seasonality, and autocorrelation\n",
    "- A Times Series is said to be stationary when the mean and variance remain constant over time.\n",
    "- A Time Series has a trend if the mean is varying over time. Often you can eliminate it and make the series stationary by applying log transformation(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seasonality** refers to the phenomenon of variations at specific time-frames. eg people buying more Christmas trees during Christmas (who would’ve thought). A common approach to eliminating seasonality is to use differencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autocorrelation** refers to the correlation between the current value with a copy from a previous time (lag).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time series problems add the complexity of order of temporal dependence between observations.\n",
    "- Adds explicit handling of order in the input observations.\n",
    "- Learning the temporal context of input sequences in order to make better predictions.\n",
    "- The temporal dependence can be learned, and perhaps changes to this dependence can also be learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation of traditional linear methods forecasting**\n",
    "\n",
    "- No support for missing or corrupt data\n",
    "- Assumption of linear relationship b/w excluding more complex joint distributions\n",
    "- Focus on fixed temporal dependence. (The relationship b/w observations at different times, and in turn the number of lag observations provided as input, must be diagnosed and specified)\n",
    "- Focus on univariate data(most real world problems : multiple i/p variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Series - Neural Networks\n",

    "- Multi-variate and Multi-step Forecasts\n",
    "\n",
    "> Feed-forward neural networks do offer great capability but still suffer from this key limitation of having to specify the temporal dependence upfront in the design of the model.\n",

    "- Fixed Inputs/ Fixed Outputs (rqmt for deep neural networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Series - Recurrent Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "- RNNs add the explicit handling of order between observations when learning a mapping function from input and outputs.\n",
    "- The addition of sequence is a new dimesnsion to the function being approximated.\n",
    "- RNN is capable of learning a mapping funciton for the inputs over time to an output.\n",
    "- Learning Temporal dependence (The context of observation over time).\n",
    "- Removing semantic structure from time series( e.g. making time-series stationary) manually to make problem easier to model.\n",
    "- The available context may allow recurrent networks to learn Trend and Seasionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Times Series is said to be stationary when the mean and variance remain constant over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trend** An increasing or decreasing level to a time series and even variation in these changes\n",
